Rain slicked the streets of the city, turning the neon signs into blurred smears of red and blue. Detective Jack Mallory lit a cigarette under the awning of a rundown diner on Fifth Street, his trench coat soaked at the edges. He wasn’t here for the coffee—he was here for answers. Three murders in three weeks, each victim found with a playing card tucked neatly into their jacket pocket. The press called the killer "The Card Dealer," but Jack had a simpler name: trouble.

The diner door jingled, and in walked trouble herself—Vivian Cross, all legs and smirks, with a crimson dress that clung to her like sin. She’d called him an hour ago, saying she had something he’d want to hear.

"Detective Mallory," she purred, sliding into the booth across from him. "I’m glad you came."

"Let’s skip the pleasantries, Vivian. You said you had information about the Card Dealer. Spill."

Vivian took her time, lighting a cigarette and letting the smoke curl around her like a veil. "I know who’s next on his list," she said, her voice low enough to make him lean in.

Jack’s jaw tightened. "And how would you know that?"

She smirked, her red lips curling at the edges. "Let’s just say I’ve got connections. The kind that see things others don’t."

Jack didn’t trust her—not her words, not her smile, and certainly not the glint in her eyes. But he couldn’t ignore the possibility she was telling the truth. "Who’s the target?"

Vivian leaned forward, her perfume wrapping around him. "You, Jack."

The world seemed to freeze for a moment, the diner’s clatter fading into the background. Jack let the weight of her words settle before speaking. "If this is some kind of game, you’d better tell me the rules."

Vivian’s eyes darkened. "It’s no game. The Card Dealer doesn’t play fair. But if you want to stay alive, you’re going to need my help."

Before Jack could respond, the diner door swung open. A man in a dark fedora stepped in, his face obscured by shadow. He moved with purpose, heading straight for their booth. Vivian’s hand slipped under the table, and Jack caught the gleam of a pistol.

"Easy," Jack muttered, slipping his own hand toward the revolver holstered under his coat.

The man stopped a few feet away, pulling a playing card from his pocket and tossing it onto the table. It landed face up: the Ace of Spades. "Message from the Dealer," the man said, his voice gravelly. "You’ve got 24 hours."

He turned and walked out before Jack could get to his feet. Vivian’s hand trembled slightly as she picked up the card, staring at it like it might bite. Jack crushed his cigarette in the ashtray, his mind racing.

"Looks like you weren’t lying," he said, grabbing his hat. "Let’s see if your connections are worth a damn."

As they stepped out into the rain, Jack couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being played. But if the Dealer wanted a game, he was going to give him one—his way, with the stakes as high as they could get.
